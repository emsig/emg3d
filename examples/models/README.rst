Models
======

Collection of electrical subsurface models. This section *does not* contain
examples of emg3d; it contains the code to create the resistivity models which
are used in other examples. In order to reduce the dependencies and the
runtime/memory requirements to build the gallery these codes are not executed,
they are just reproduced here. To run these examples you will need to install
additional dependencies or download data; this info is provided in each
example.
