Info, tips & tricks

   The CPU & RAM part needs rework, big part should move into the development
   section.


Coordinate System
-----------------

The coordinate system is shown in :numref:`Figure %s <coordinate_system>`. It
is a right-handed system (RHS) with x pointing East, y pointing North, and z
pointing upwards. The azimuth is defined as the anticlockwise rotation from
Easting towards Northing, and elevation is defined as the anticlockwise
rotation from the horizontal plane up.

   Coordinate system used in emg3d: RHS with positive z upwards.


Grid dimension
--------------

The function :func:`emg3d.solver.solve` is the main entry point, and it takes
care whether multigrid is used as a solver or as a preconditioner (or not at
all), while the actual multigrid solver is :func:`emg3d.solver.multigrid`. Most
input parameters for :func:`emg3d.solver.solve` are sufficiently described in
its docstring. Here a few additional information.

- You can input any three-dimensional tensor mesh into `emg3d`. However, the
  implemented multigrid technique works with the existing nodes, meaning there
  are no new nodes created as coarsening is done by combining adjacent
  cells. The more times the grid dimension can be divided by two the better it
  is suited for MG. Ideally, the number should be dividable by two a few times
  and the dimension of the coarsest grid should be a low prime number
  :math:`p`, for which good sizes can then be computed with :math:`p 2^n`. Good
  grid sizes (in each direction) up to 1024 are

  - :math:`2·2^{3, 4, ..., 9}`: 16,  32,  64, 128, 256, 512, 1024,
  - :math:`3·2^{3, 4, ..., 8}`: 24,  48,  96, 192, 384, 768,
  - :math:`5·2^{3, 4, ..., 7}`: 40,  80, 160, 320, 640,
  - :math:`7·2^{3, 4, ..., 7}`: 56, 112, 224, 448, 896,

  and preference decreases from top to bottom row (stick to the first two or
  three rows if possible). Good grid sizes in sequential order, excluding p=7:
  16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 96, 128, 160, 192, 256, 320, 384, 512, 640, 768,
  1024. You can get this list via :func:`emg3d.meshes.good_mg_cell_nr()`.

- The multigrid method can be used as a solver or as a preconditioner, for
  instance for BiCGSTAB. Using multigrid as a preconditioner for BiCGSTAB
  together with semicoarsening and line relaxation is the most stable version,
  but expensive, and therefore only recommended on highly stretched grids.
  Which combination of solver is best (fastest) depends to a large extent on
  the grid stretching, but also on anisotropy and general model complexity.
  See `«Parameter tests»
  <https://emsig.xyz/emg3d-gallery/gallery/tutorials/parameter_tests.html>`_
  in the gallery for an example how to run some tests on your particular
  problem.


CPU & RAM
---------

The multigrid method is attractive because it shows optimal scaling for both
runtime and memory consumption. In the following are a few notes regarding
memory and runtime requirements. It also contains information about what has
been tried and what still could be tried in order to improve the current code.


Runtime
```````

The `gallery <https://emsig.xyz/emg3d-gallery>`_ contains a script to
do some testing with regards to runtime, see the `Tools Section
<https://emsig.xyz/emg3d-gallery/gallery/index.html#tools>`_. An
example output of that script is shown in :numref:`Figure %s <runtime>`.

.. figure:: ../_static/runtime.svg
   :width: 80 %
   :align: center
   :alt: Runtime
   :name: runtime

   Runtime as a function of cell size, which shows nicely the linear scaling
   of multigrid solvers (using a single thread).

The costliest functions (for big models) are:

   - >90 %: :func:`emg3d.solver.smoothing` (:func:`emg3d.core.gauss_seidel`)
   - <5 % each, in decreasing importance:

      - :func:`emg3d.solver.prolongation`
        (:class:`emg3d.solver.RegularGridProlongator`)
      - :func:`emg3d.solver.residual` (:func:`emg3d.core.amat_x`)
      - :func:`emg3d.solver.restriction`

Example with 262,144 / 2,097,152 cells (``nu_{i,1,c,2}=0,2,1,2``;
``sslsolver=False``; ``semicoarsening=True``; ``linerelaxation=True``):

   - 93.7 / 95.8 % ``smoothing``
   - 3.6 / 2.0 % ``prolongation``
   - 1.9 / 1.9 % ``residual``
   - 0.6 / 0.4 % ``restriction``

The rest can be ignored. For small models, the percentage of ``smoothing`` goes
down and of ``prolongation`` and ``restriction`` go up. But then the modeller
is fast anyway.

:func:`emg3d.core.gauss_seidel` and :func:`emg3d.core.amat_x` are written
in ``numba``; jitting :class:`emg3d.solver.RegularGridProlongator` turned out
to not improve things, and many functions used in the restriction are jitted
too. The costliest functions (RAM- and CPU-wise) are therefore already written
in ``numba``.

**Any serious attempt to improve the speed will have to tackle the smoothing
itself.**


**Things which could be tried**

- Not much has been tested with the ``numba``-options ``parallel``; ``prange``;
  and ``nogil``.
- There might be an additional gain by making :class:`emg3d.meshes.TensorMesh`,
  :class:`emg3d.models.Model`, and :class:`emg3d.fields.Field` instances jitted
  classes.

**Things which have been tried**

- One important aspect of the smoothing part is the memory layout.
  :func:`emg3d.core.gauss_seidel` and :func:`emg3d.core.gauss_seidel_x`
  are ideal for F-arrays (loop z-y-x, hence slowest to fastest axis).
  :func:`emg3d.core.gauss_seidel_y` and
  :func:`emg3d.core.gauss_seidel_z`, however, would be optimal for C-arrays.
  But copying the arrays to C-order and afterwards back is costlier in most
  cases for both CPU and RAM. The one possible and therefore implemented
  solution was to swap the loop-order in :func:`emg3d.core.gauss_seidel_y`.
- Restriction and prolongation information could be saved in a dictionary
  instead of recomputing it every time. Turns out to be not worth the
  trouble.
- Rewrite :class:`emg3d.solver.RegularGridProlongator` as jitted function, but
  the iterator approach seems to be better for large grids.


Memory
``````

Most of the memory requirement comes from storing the data itself, mainly the
fields (source field, electric field, and residual field) and the model
parameters (resistivity, eta, mu). For a big model, they some up; e.g., almost
3 GB for an isotropic model with 256x256x256 cells.

The `gallery <https://emsig.xyz/emg3d-gallery>`_ contains a script to
do some testing with regards to the RAM usage, see the `Tools Section
<https://emsig.xyz/emg3d-gallery/gallery/index.html#tools>`_. An
example output of that script is shown in :numref:`Figure %s <ramusage>`.

.. figure:: ../_static/RAM-Usage.svg
   :width: 80 %
   :align: center
   :alt: RAM Usage
   :name: ramusage

   RAM usage, showing the optimal behaviour of multigrid methods. "Data RAM" is
   the memory required by the fields (source field, electric field, residual
   field) and by the model parameters (resistivity; and eta, mu). "MG Base" is
   for solving one Gauss-Seidel iteration on the original grid. "MG full RAM"
   is for solving one multigrid F-Cycle.


The theory of multigrid says that in an ideal scenario, multigrid requires
8/7 (a bit over 1.14) the memory requirement of carrying out one Gauss-Seidel
step on the finest grid. As can be seen in the figure, for models up to 2
million cells that holds pretty much, afterwards it becomes a bit worse.

However, for this estimation one has to run the model first. Another way to
estimate the requirement is by starting from the RAM used to store the fields
and parameters. As can be seen in the figure, for big models one is on the
save side estimating the required RAM as 1.35 times the storage required for
the fields and model parameters.

The figure also shows nicely the linear behaviour of multigrid; for twice the
number of cells twice the memory is required (from a certain size onwards).

**Attempts at improving memory usage should focus on the difference between the
red line (actual usage) and the dashed black line (1.14 x base usage).**
