Contributing
============

New contributions, bug reports, or any kind of feedback is always welcomed!
Have a look at the `Roadmap-project
<https://github.com/emsig/emg3d/projects/1>`_ to get an idea of things that
could be implemented. The GitHub `issues
<https://github.com/emsig/emg3d/issues>`_ and
`PR's <https://github.com/emsig/emg3d/pulls>`_ are also a good starting
point. The best way for interaction is at https://github.com/emsig or by
joining the `Slack channel <http://slack.simpeg.xyz>`_ «em-x-d» of SimPEG. If
you prefer to get in touch outside of GitHub/Slack use the contact form on
https://werthmuller.org.

To install emg3d from source, you can download the latest version from GitHub
and install it in your python distribution via:

.. code-block:: console

   python setup.py install

Please make sure your code follows the pep8-guidelines by using, for instance,
the python module ``flake8``, and also that your code is covered with
appropriate tests. Just get in touch if you have any doubts.
