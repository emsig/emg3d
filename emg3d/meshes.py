def construct_mesh(frequency, properties, center, domain=None, vector=None,
                   seasurface=None, **kwargs):
    r"""Return a TensorMesh for given parameters.

    Designing an appropriate grid is the most time-consuming part of any 3D
    modelling:

    - Cell sizes should be small enough to represent changes in the model as
      well as to minimize interpolation errors in the fields.
    - The computational domain has to be big enough to avoid effects from the
      boundary condition.
    - The total number of cells should be small to speed up computation.

    These are in itself contradictory requirements, and they additionally
    depend all on the subsurface properties, the frequency under consideration,
    and the survey type.

    This function is a helper routine to construct an appropriate grid.
    However, there is no guarantee that it is the best or even a good grid. The
    constructed grid is frequency- and property-dependent. Some details are
    explained in other functions:

    - The minimum cell width :math:`\Delta_\text{min}` is a function of
      ``frequency``, ``properties[0]``, ``min_width_pps``, and
      ``min_width_limits``, see Equation :eq:`mincellwidth`.
    - The skin depth :math:`\delta` is a function of ``frequency`` and
      ``properties``, see Equation :eq:`skindepth`.
    - The wavelength :math:`\lambda` is a function of ``frequency`` and
      ``properties``, see Equation :eq:`wavelength`.

    The relation of the survey domain, computational domain, and buffer zone is
    shown in  :numref:`Figure %s <AutoGrid>` for a x-z-section; the y-direction
    behaves the same as the x-direction (the figures are only visible in the
    web version of the API docs on https://emg3d.emsig.xyz).

    .. figure:: ../_static/construct_mesh.png
       :align: center
       :alt: Sketch for automatic gridding.
       :name: AutoGrid

       Relation between survey domain (Ds, ``domain``), computational domain
       (Dc), and buffer zone. The survey domain should contain all sources (red
       stars) and receivers (blue triangles) as well as any important feature
       that should be represented in the data. The buffer zone is calculated as
       a function of wavelength with the provided property in the given
       direction.

    The buffer zone around the survey domain is by default one wavelength. This
    means that the signal has to travel two wavelengths to get from the end of
    the survey domain to the end of the computational domain and back. This
    approach is quite conservative and on the safe side. You can reduce the
    buffer thickness if you know what you are doing. There are three parameters
    which influence the thickness of the buffer for a given frequency:
    ``properties``, which is used to calculate the skin depth and the
    wavelength, ``lambda_factor`` (default is 1) which sets how many times the
    wavelength is the thickness of the buffer (relative factor), and
    ``max_buffer``, which is an absolute maximum for the buffer thickness. A
    graphical illustration is given in :numref:`Figure %s <Buffer>`.

    .. figure:: ../_static/construct_mesh2.png
       :align: center
       :alt: Sketch for the buffer zone.
       :name: Buffer

       The thickness of the buffer zone (B) for (I)
       ``lambda_from_center=False`` (default) and for (II)
       ``lambda_from_center=True``. The ``lambda_factor``
       (:math:`\lambda_{fact}`) is a simple scaling factor for the wavelength
       :math:`\lambda`. The ``max_buffer`` is an absolute limitation.


    Parameters
    ----------

    frequency : float
        Frequency (Hz) to calculate skin depth; both the minimum cell width and
        the extent of the buffer zone, and therefore of the computational
        domain, are a function of skin depth.

    properties : {float, array_like}
        Properties to calculate the skin depths, which in turn are used to
        calculate the minimum cell width (usually at source location) and the
        extent of the buffer around the survey domain. The properties can be
        either resistivities, conductivities, or the logarithm (natural or base
        10) thereof. By default it assumes resistivities, but it can be changed
        with the parameter ``mapping``.

        Five formats are recognized for properties: it can either be a float or
        a list of 2, 3, 4, or 7 floats. Depending on the format these
        properties are used to calculate the following parameters:

        - ``p``: min_width and buffer in all directions;

        - ``[p1, p2]``:

          - ``p1`` : min_width,
          - ``p2`` : buffer in all directions;

        - ``[p1, p2, p3]``:

          - ``p1`` : min_width,
          - ``p2`` : buffer in negative z-direction,
          - ``p3`` : buffer in all other directions;

        - ``[p1, p2, p3, p4]``:

          - ``p1`` : min_width,
          - ``p2`` : buffer in horizontal directions,
          - ``p3``; ``p4`` : buffer in negative; positive z-direction.

        - ``[p1, p2, p3, p4, p5, p6, p7]``:

          - ``p1`` : min_width,
          - ``p2``; ``p3`` : buffer in negative; positive x-direction,
          - ``p4``; ``p5`` : buffer in negative; positive y-direction,
          - ``p6``; ``p7`` : buffer in negative; positive z-direction.

    center : array_like
        Center coordinates (x, y, z). The mesh is centered around this point,
        which means that here is the smallest cell. Usually this is the source
        location. Note that from v1.9.0 the default will change: until then,
        the center is assumed to be at the edge; from v1.9.0 onwards, it is
        assumed to be at the cell center. It can be changed via the parameter
        ``center_on_edge``.

    domain : {tuple, list, dict, None}, optional
        Contains the survey-domain limits. This domain should include all
        source and receiver positions as well as any important feature of the
        model. Format: ``([xmin, xmax], [ymin, ymax], [zmin, zmax])`` or
        ``{'x': [xmin, xmax], 'y': [ymin, ymax], 'z': [zmin, zmax]}``.

        It can be None, or individual lists can be None (e.g., ``(None, None,
        [zmin, zmax])``), in which case you have to provide either the
        corresponding ``distance`` or a ``vector``, from which the domain is
        then calculated. If only one list is provided it is applied to all
        dimensions.

    distance : {tuple, list, dict, None}, optional
        An alternative to ``domain``: Instead of defining the domain in
        absolute values, they are defined here as distance from the center.
        Format:
        ``([xl, xr], [yl, yr], [zd, zu])`` or
        ``{'x': [xl, xr], 'y': [yl, yr], 'z': [zd, zu]}``.
        From this the domain is given as
        ``([cx-xl, cx+xr], [cy-yl, cy+yr], [cz-zd, cz+zu])``,
        where ``center=(cx, cy, cz)``.

    vector : {tuple, ndarray, dict, None}, optional
        Contains vectors of mesh-edges that should be used. Format:
        ``(xvector, yvector, zvector)`` or
        ``{'x': xvector, 'y': yvector, 'z': zvector}``.

        If also ``domain`` or ``distance`` is defined, the following happens:

        - There must be at least two cells within the domain, otherwise
          ``vector`` is set to None.
        - Where the ``vector`` is outside the domain, it will be trimmed to it.
        - Where the ``vector`` is smaller than the domain, it will be extended
          following the normal rules. The last cell-width in each direction
          will be taken as starting cell width, together with the domain
          stretching factor.

        It can be None, or individual ndarrays can be None (e.g., ``(xvector,
        yvector, None)``), in which case you have to provide a ``domain`` or
        ``distance``. If only one ndarray is provided it is applied to all
        dimensions.

    center_on_edge : {tuple, bool, dict, None}, optional
        Contains booleans defining if `center` is at the edge or at the cell
        center. Format:
        ``None``, ``bool``, ``(xbool, ybool, zbool)`` or
        ``{'x': xbool, 'y': ybool, 'z': zbool}``.

        Only relevant if no vector is provided in given direction.

    seasurface : float, default: None
        Air-sea interface, has to be above the center. This has only to be set
        in the marine case, when the mesh in z-direction is sought for (and the
        seasurface is not contained in ``vector``). If set, it will try to
        ensure that at the sea surface is an actual boundary.

        If the seasurface lies higher than the survey domain it will increase
        the survey domain to include the seasurface.

        If the seasurface is too close to the center it will most likely fail
        to find a good grid. It will still create the grid, raising a warning
        that the seasurface is not at an actual boundary.

    stretching : {tuple, list, dict}, default: [1.0, 1.5]
        Maximum stretching factors in the form of ``[max Ds, max Dc]``: the
        first value is the maximum stretching for the survey domain (default is
        1.0), the second value is the maximum stretching for the buffer zone
        (default is 1.5). If a list is provided the same is used for all three
        dimension. Alternatively a tuple of three lists can be provided, ``(x,
        y, z)`` or ``{'x': x, 'y': y, 'z': z}``. Note that the first value has
        no influence on dimensions where a ``vector`` is provided.

    min_width_limits : {float, list, tuple, dict, None}, default: None
        Passed through to :func:`cell_width` as ``limits``. A tuple of three
        or a dict with ``x;y;z`` can be provided for direction dependent
        values. Note that this value has no influence on dimensions where a
        ``vector`` is provided.

    min_width_pps : {float, tuple, dict}, default: 3.0
        Passed through to :func:`cell_width` as ``pps``. A tuple of three or a
        dict with ``x;y;z`` can be provided for direction dependent values.
        Note that this value has no influence on dimensions where a ``vector``
        is provided.

    lambda_factor : float, default: 1.0
        The buffer is taken as one wavelength from the survey domain. This can
        be regarded as quite conservative (but safe). The parameter
        ``lambda_factor`` can be used to reduce (or increase) this factor.

    max_buffer : float, default: 100_000
        Maximum thickness of the buffer zone around survey domain. If
        ``lambda_from_center=True``, this is the maximum distance from the
        center to the end of the computational domain.

    lambda_from_center : bool, default: False
        Flag how to compute the extent of the computational mesh as a function
        of wavelength:

        - False (default): The distance from the edge of the survey domain to
          the edge of the computational domain is one wavelength.
        - True: The distance from the center to the edge of the computational
          domain and back to the end of the survey domain is two wavelengths.

    mapping : {str, Map}, default: 'Resistivity'
        Defines what type the input ``property_{x;y;z}``-values correspond to.
        By default, they represent resistivities (Ohm.m). The implemented
        mappings are:

        - ``'Resistivity'``; ρ (Ω m);
        - ``'Conductivity'``; σ (S/m);
        - ``'LgResistivity'``; log_10(ρ);
        - ``'LgConductivity'``; log_10(σ);
        - ``'LnResistivity'``; log_e(ρ);
        - ``'LnConductivity'``; log_e(σ).

    cell_numbers : array_like, optional
        List of possible numbers of cells. See :func:`good_mg_cell_nr`.
        Default is ``good_mg_cell_nr(1024, 5, 3)``, which corresponds to
        numbers 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 64, 80, 96, 128, 160, 192, 256, 320, 384,
        512, 640, 768, 1024.

    verb : int, default: 0
        If 1 verbose, if 0 silent. The info is added either way to the returned
        mesh as ``mesh.construct_mesh_info``.

    :func:`construct_mesh` once in each direction.

    .. note::

        The parameters are described in :func:`construct_mesh`. Described here
        are only the differences. It is recommended to use directly

    Parameters
    ----------

    verb : int, default: 0
        If 1 verbose, if 0 silent, if -1 it returns the info as string instead
        of printing it.

    raise_error : bool, default: True
        If True, an error is raised if no suitable grid is found. Otherwise it
        just returns None's (used by ``construct_mesh``).

    Returns
    -------
    origin : float
        Origin of the mesh.

    widths : ndarray
        Cell widths of mesh.

    info : str, returned if verb<0

    """Estimate parameters for automatic gridding.

    Automatically determines the required gridding options from the provided
    model, and survey, if they are not provided in ``gridding_opts``.

    The dict ``gridding_opts`` can contain any input parameter taken by
    :func:`emg3d.meshes.construct_mesh`, see the corresponding documentation
    for more details with regards to the possibilities.

    Different keys of ``gridding_opts`` are treated differently:

    - The following parameters are estimated from the ``model`` if not
      provided:

      - ``properties``: lowest conductivity / highest resistivity in the
        outermost layer in a given direction. This is usually air in x/y and
        positive z. Note: This is very conservative. If you go into deeper
        water you could provide less conservative values.
      - ``mapping``: taken from model.

    - The following parameters are estimated from the ``survey`` if not
      provided:

      - ``frequency``: average (on log10-scale) of all frequencies.
      - ``center``: center of all sources.
      - ``domain``: from  ``distance`` or ``vector``, if provided, or

        - in x/y-directions: extent of sources and receivers plus 10% on each
          side, ensuring ratio of 3.
        - in z-direction: extent of sources and receivers, ensuring ratio of 2
          to horizontal dimension; 1/10 tenth up, 9/10 down.

        The ratio means that it is enforced that the survey dimension in x or
        y-direction is not smaller than a third of the survey dimension in the
        other direction. If not, the smaller dimension is expanded
        symmetrically. Similarly in the vertical direction, which must be at
        least half the dimension of the maximum horizontal dimension or 5 km,
        whatever is smaller. Otherwise it is expanded in a ratio of 9 parts
        downwards, one part upwards.

    - The following parameter is taken from the ``grid`` if provided as a
      string:

      - ``vector``: This is the only real "difference" to the inputs of
        :func:`emg3d.meshes.construct_mesh`. The normal input is accepted, but
        it can also be a string containing any combination of ``'x'``, ``'y'``,
        and ``'z'``. All directions contained in this string are then taken
        from the provided grid. E.g., if ``gridding_opts['vector']='xz'`` it
        will take the x- and z-directed vectors from the grid.

    - The following parameters are simply passed along if they are provided,
      nothing is done otherwise:

      - ``vector``
      - ``distance``
      - ``stretching``
      - ``seasurface``
      - ``cell_numbers``
      - ``lambda_factor``
      - ``lambda_from_center``
      - ``max_buffer``
      - ``min_width_limits``
      - ``min_width_pps``
      - ``verb``


    Parameters
    ----------
    gridding_opts : dict
        Containing input parameters to provide to
        :func:`emg3d.meshes.construct_mesh`. See the corresponding
        documentation and the explanations above.

    model : Model
        The model; a :class:`emg3d.models.Model` instance.

    survey : Survey
        The survey; a :class:`emg3d.surveys.Survey` instance.

    input_sc2 : int, default: None
        If :func:`emg3d.models.expand_grid_model` was used, ``input_sc2``
        corresponds to the original ``grid.shape_cells[2]``.
